# AI-Trust-Warning

**Purpose:**  
This single-page site is the landing destination for a flyer posted around Madison, WI.  
It’s designed to make visitors pause and question how easily we trust digital prompts—especially QR codes—at a time when advanced, unverified AI could already influence what we read, watch, and believe.

## How it works
* The flyer warns people *not* to scan the QR code if the message convinces them.  
* Those who scan anyway arrive here and are greeted with a short reflection on trust, curiosity, and AI manipulation.  
* The page links to *The AI Revolution* (Wait But Why) for deeper context and invites readers to view the page source to confirm there’s no hidden tracking.

## Files
* `index.html` – the entire site (static, no scripts)
* `qr.png` (optional) – QR code pointing to this page
* `flyer.pdf` (optional) – low-ink flyer ready for print
